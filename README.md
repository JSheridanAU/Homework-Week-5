# Financial Planner

#### This is my homework submission for Week 5 of the Monash Fintech Bootcamp.
#### The assignment questions are contained within the financial-planner.ipynb file as the work progresses.
#### In this assignment we access data from www.alternatve.me and www.alpaca.markets, and retrieve datasets from the returns.
#### We do some basic calculations with the coin data and return results. With the Alpaca data we present some pie charts, run a Monte Carlo simulation and present a line plot and distribution plot of the results, and provide the 95% Confidence Results of various investment amounts and time periods.
